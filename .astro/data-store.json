But I think my views on ambition – what it is, what it means, what it looks like – are changing.\n\nI used to think \"oh I'm not ambitious\". Ambition, to, me, looked like someone who had a strong business/entrepreneurial/career/whatever drive. My wife Amanda [is ambitious](https://welevelupcreators.com/). She has a beautiful drive to create, to achieve, to accomplish.\n\nWhen it comes to \"traditional\" career-y things, I just... don't. Sure, I want to do my work well, whatever that is. But I'm not driven to climb the ladder, start a big thing, etc. At least, not right now.\n\nAnd honestly I've _tried_ to want those things, in the past. I've run more than one business, but they didn't make me feel alive.\n\nSo I've always assumed I must not be ambitious, and I've tried to convince myself that I'm ok with that. And, by those traditional definitions, sure, I'm ok with it.\n\nBut I'm coming around to ambition not really meaning that at all. Or at least, meaning a lot more things than that. Because really, I _do have ambition_. I'm just figuring out it looks a little different than \"normal\" (???) ambition.\n\nMy ambition is more like: I want to learn how to become who I am. I want to grow, and experience deep relationships and intimacy and beauty and knowledge and wisdom. I want to alter the world around me, to bend it toward love and kindness and goodness. I feel these things growing inside of me, starting to sprout and well up, and I'm excited and really quite a bit scared at what that means. Scared at what I'll need to do, how I'll need to go way outside my comfort zone, to embrace that ambition and actually, really, share it with the world.\n\nSide note: none of this is dismissive of \"normal\" ambition. I deeply admire and respect people who have that drive, and I think that is crucial for our growth as humans, as a people, etc. It's what drives progress and innovation and prosperity. And people who have that drive are often sharing something with the world that helps other people in enormous ways (see my wife as an example), and particularly helps other people do more of what I'm talking about, makes it possible to share themselves more fully with the world.\n\nOk, so, ambition: for me, it's... all those things I listed above. I think this is something that's been building for a while, and mostly I've been ignoring it because I thought/felt for whatever reason that it wasn't practical, that the realities of life meant I needed to focus elsewhere. But more and more it's starting to feel like this slowly but steadily growing force that can't be ignored. Maybe that's what the \"normal\" ambition/drive feels like to other people, too! Like... you just have to do this thing.\n\nSo, my challenge/task/whatever, I guess, is to figure out what that looks like, in practice, for me. What is the thing I have to do? Right now it looks like writing, mostly, but surely that's not enough, or not all there is to it, right? I suppose my hope in writing this kind of thing is that hey, writing connects people, and people who are on a similar path, or maybe who have already been down this path, see me and what I'm saying will resonate, and then hey presto, connections.\n\nAnd if nothing else, word-vomiting all this out is awfully clarifying and motivating.

I honestly have no idea. I was thinking there was two routes to go down. 1) work with agencies or 2) work with small businesses. I figured the agency route would be much easier from a developer point-of-view, but since I haven’t done either, I’m just guessing. Which do you work with? Have a preference? Advice?\n\nHere's what I said, which should be useful to others not in his specific situation as well:\n\nWe ([The Bright Agency](http://brightagency.net/)) pretty much exclusively work directly with the end client. We've been happy with that, but if I were starting from a blank slate, I'd be going after whatever I could find, and building some agency relationships would almost certainly be part of that. I wouldn't advise making that a long-term strategy as I believe your profit would be very limited, but it would get some projects under your belt and pay the bills. At the same time, I'd be trying to find end-client work as well. I think I'd give Robert Williams' [Workshop](http://letsworkshop.com/) a try - I haven't paid for the service as we get enough work without it, but his content is great, and I think it's a compelling sales pitch for someone in your position.\n\nI'd also **strongly suggest** reading [Double Your Freelancing Rate](http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/) if you haven't already - it has a pretty solid foundation on pricing, how you position yourself and communicate that to leads/clients, etc. I'm a big believer in moving beyond the \"$xx/hour for \\_\\_\\_\\_ development/design service\" model, and toward the \"$xxx/hour or \\$xx,xxx/week for making your business big money\" model. I'd also suggest calling yourself a \"consultant\", instead of a \"freelancer\". Again, it's all about the positioning.","src/content/blog/advice-new-freelancer.mdx","93268b9e26a8d938","bad-design",{"id":32,"data":34,"body":37,"filePath":38,"digest":39,"deferredRender":13},{"title":35,"description":14,"pubDate":36},"Bad Design™",["Date","2018-04-25T00:00:00.000Z"],"import { Tweet } from \"astro-embed\";\nimport OldPost from \"../../components/OldPost.astro\";\n\n\u003COldPost />\n\nI tweeted this recently, and it deserves a little more explanation (and permanence):\n\n\u003CTweet id=\"https://twitter.com/tnorthcutt/status/985585855761997824\" />\n\nThe key quote:\n\n> We’ve now learned Google will also introduce “Confidential Mode,” which lets Gmail users stop recipients from forwarding certain emails, or restricts the ability to copy, download, or print them.\n\nHere's the thing: if you send someone an email – even if it \"expires\" after a set amount of time, or gmail somehow prevents them from copying/downloading/printing text and/or images from it, **they can still share it.** All they have to do is take a screenshot – or a literal picture with, say, their phone – and share that.\n\n![Picture of this post](/images/screen-pic.jpg)\n\n_Look, I took a picture with my phone. This isn't hard._\n\nSure, this has some utility. For instance, you could share a password with someone with an \"expiring\" email, and be sure (not that I'd trust Google to actually delete anything...)  it won't be sitting in their email inbox forever, just waiting for a future hacker to come along and find it.\n\nBut promoting this as a way to prevent sharing of information is misleading, user-hostile, and bad design.

I see so many people at least present as being certain about so many things – politics, religion, relationships, careers, technology, motivations, incentives, economics, science, health, diet, exercise, what color you should paint your bedroom, etc.\n\nWhat's interesting is I suspect and to some extent know that I was this way, or at least moreso than I am now, when I was younger. Is that just a symptom of inexperience and lack of perspective? I'm not sure. I suspect that's at least a contributing factor, though.\n\nI don't really intend for this to be just a lament in the style of \"old man yells at clouds\", so what am I writing this for? I suppose it's to explore the idea of uncertainty, to roll around that big ball of uncertainty, and see how it feels.\n\nI suspect one could begin to feel more and more uncertain about things and react with a kind of panic – sort of an \"oh no, if I don't know x anymore, how can I function???\". I'm finding myself having the opposite reaction much of the time, blessedly. More like \"I don't really know the answer to x, isn't that amusing?\"\n\nI do still have _opinions_ about things, but I try to intentionally treat them as sort of \"trial\" things, if that makes any sense. More like \"I kinda suspect x about y, I wonder if that will end up being right?\"\n\nOk, so maybe an interesting thing to explore is where I maybe _do_ still feel some degree of certainty, and try to challenge that. Sort of do the \"ok but what if I'm completely wrong about this?\" exercise on something I feel more strongly about.\n\nFor instance, in my work I sometimes get frustrated that some people like to build things with what I perceive as far more technical complexity than is needed. My biased opinion is that people do this because they simply enjoy making complex things, enjoy learning new things/technologies, or (when I'm feeling less charitable) want to bulk up their resume by learning a new technology.\n\nMy pretty strong sense is that this is a net \"bad\". Of course it depends on what \"bad\" means in this context, what your goals are, what your utility function is, etc. And probably that's where the disagreement/tension comes from, really – my utility function is more like \"accomplish x business goal as simply as possible, because a simple solution will be more maintainable and use fewer resources\". But perhaps someone else's is \"accomplish x business goal while preparing as much as possible for future needs, because increased future needs almost always happen and it's best to build in additional capacity early on\". Or, less charitably, \"accomplish x business goal while improving my future job prospects as much as possible because corporations do not care about you and a rationale actor should be selfish in their dealings with an employer\".\n\nWhich, really, put that way, I don't think I disagree with! Perhaps an essay for another day, but a sort of pet peeve of mine is when people pretend that an employing corporation cares about employees and you should be willing to make selfless sacrifices for them. I find that exploitative and disgusting. But, like I said, another day.\n\nOk, so, it almost seems like I'm a little less certain about my work thing, huh? Maybe just exploring that and introspecting a bit helped reduce my certainty. I don't think I've changed _my_ preferences or utility function, but perhaps I've grown my empathy in that area a bit? Not sure, but one can hope.\n\nI hope as I grow older I'm starting to gain a little equanimity, in some ways and areas. In the past I've felt a little... frustrated, I think, because I felt like I didn't have much equanimity, and I perhaps sought out ways to suppress my emotions. I've since tried to embrace my enthusiasm and excitability, and encourage it in times when I feel that's healthy. So maybe the equanimity I want is more about embracing uncertainty, and less about being stoic or calm all the time.\n\nIn closing, a fable that has resonated with me for a long time and serves as a helpful reminder. I've copied this from [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/horses) in case that page is ever removed on his site:\n\n> A farmer had only one horse. One day, his horse ran away.\n>\n> His neighbors said, “I’m so sorry. This is such bad news.

Or, less charitably, “accomplish x business goal while improving my future job prospects as much as possible because corporations do not care about you and a rationale actor should be selfish in their dealings with an employer”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Which, really, put that way, I don’t think I disagree with! Perhaps an essay for another day, but a sort of pet peeve of mine is when people pretend that an employing corporation cares about employees and you should be willing to make selfless sacrifices for them. I find that exploitative and disgusting. But, like I said, another day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ok, so, it almost seems like I’m a little less certain about my work thing, huh?

I’ve since tried to embrace my enthusiasm and excitability, and encourage it in times when I feel that’s healthy. So maybe the equanimity I want is more about embracing uncertainty, and less about being stoic or calm all the time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In closing, a fable that has resonated with me for a long time and serves as a helpful reminder.

Spark uses Bootstrap out of the box, which I wanted to move away from for two reasons:\n\n1. I find it a bit clunky and restricting, personally\n2. I'd built a sales site for MemberScore (at memberscore.io), and I wanted the actual app (at app.memberscore.io) to match the sales site appearance.\n\nI haven't converted the entire app to use Tailwind (yet?), but the nav is now converted and fully functional.\n\n### Here's how I did it\n\nEssentially, we're going to recreate all the nav-related Spark views, and swap out the various css classes to take advantage of Tailwind, removing Bootstrap-related ones and instead using Tailwind classes to get the nav looking how we want.\n\nThe first step is to install Tailwind. If you're not sure whether you'll want to make this change permanently, **I highly recommend** including Tailwind via CDN as referenced in [the docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), rather than going through the relative hassle of including it via npm.\n\nIf you're ready to commit, you'll need to include `tailwindcss` in your `package.json` file. I also needed to bump the version of `laravel-mix` I was loading, from `^0.12.0` to `^2.0`. I also included [laravel-mix-tailwind](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix-tailwind).\n\nIn my `webpack.mix.js` file, I was then able to follow the instructions provided by [laravel-mix-tailwind](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix-tailwind), and get Tailwind compiling ok after adding the tailwind directives to the **end** of my `app.less` file:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/bfe7e103c1840b9f99fdbc7bd0234331.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nYou'll notice the `bootstrap-overrides.less` file there; I had to make a couple of additions to override some default Bootstrap files that didn't play well with Tailwind:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/610cb8ee7884d43e521dbfb9362d1cd3.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nThat may not be the Right Way™ to do this, but it's working ok for me.\n\nNext, I had to figure out how to get two things working:\n\n1. The toggling of the main nav menu on small screens\n2. The account switcher/settings/kiosk etc. dropdown in the nav\n\nI ended up creating a single file Vue template called `MainNav.vue` and using it as an inline template; this let me still use blade helpers within it. Here's the template:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/d0a310530e9eba955622e6f9d473f473.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nAnd where it's used in `resources/views/nav/user.blade.php`:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/594d767ead56f1a04cf5a030402cb29b.js\">\u003C/script>\n\n### Toggling visibility\n\nNotice the `navOpen` and `dropdownOpen` props, and associated `toggleNav()` and `toggleDropdown()` methods; those handle showing/hiding the two items mentioned previously. You can see there's a button that calls `toggleNav()`, and the main div containing the nav items applies a class, either `block` or `hidden`, depending on the current value of `navOpen` (which is what `toggleNav()` alters).\n\nThe dropdown toggling is done exactly the same; you can see `dropdown-toggle.blade.php` is included in the main nav file. For some reason, I ended up with `dropdown.blade.php` being `@include()`\\-ed in `dropdown-toggle.blade.php` instead other way around, but the names don't really matter.\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/10a91f7da3141e7a208cb9da1d5f8c9d.js\">\u003C/script>\n\n### Wrap up\n\nThat's the general *gist* of how I did this. I'm sure this isn't all done as perfectly as it could be, but it's functional, looks how I want it, and I understand it – and those three things go a long way in production.\n\nIf you have any questions, or suggestions, shoot me an email at travis@travisnorthcutt.com. I'd love to hear from you.","src/content/blog/converting-laravel-spark-navigation-to-tailwind-css.mdx","ba6342a6738701ae","git-wip",{"id":74,"data":76,"body":79,"filePath":80,"digest":81,"deferredRender":13},{"title":77,"description":14,"pubDate":78},"How I make WIP git commits painless",["Date","2021-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"],"I'm a huge fan of WIP (work-in-progress) commits for pressing pause, so to speak, in the middle of work on a fix or feature. It's not uncommon that I'll need to context switch in the middle of work on some feature to help someone else on my team out with checking something, because it's the end of my work day/session and I don't have a clean set of changes to commit, etc. Sometimes `git stash` can be useful for this, especially if I know it's a quick context switch and I'll be right back to what I was working on. However, sometimes using stash can get messy, or just confusing, and so I avoid that if there are a lot of changes.\n\nInstead, I like to use WIP commits in these situations, where I basically do `git add -A && git commit -m'WIP'`. This adds all unstaged changes, and commits them with the commit message `WIP`. But as much as I like using WIP commits for placeholders/pausing work, I hate commit messages that aren't descriptive. There's nothing worse than using `git blame` to try and figure out why some change was made and seeing a two year old commit with tons of changes with the message \"WIP\".\n\nSo instead, I always undo my WIP commits when I return to whatever I was working on. To do that, I use `git reset \"HEAD^\"`. To make things easier, I have these two aliases set up – note that these work for me with zsh as my shell; you may need to tweak them if you use bash, fish, etc.\n\n```\nalias wip=\"git add -A && git commit -m'WIP'\"\nalias guncommit='git reset \"HEAD^\"'\n```\n\nThe problem with WIP commits, though, is that you might return to work on a particular branch a few minutes later... or a few hours, days, or weeks later. In some cases, you might forget that you had some work in progress, and forget that you made a WIP commit. To solve this problem, in my zsh prompt, I have a function that checks for the existence of a WIP commit, and if it exists, makes that very obvious in my terminal:\n\n```\nwip=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)\nif [[ $wip = \"wip\" || $wip = \"WIP\" ]]; then\n    prompt_segment red black\n    echo -n \"\u003Cwip>\"\nfi\n```\n\nThis code checks if the most recent commit message was `wip` or `WIP`, and if so, outputs a prompt segment in red with black text that simply says `\u003CWIP>`. This is unmissable in my terminal:\n\n![](/images/git-wip.png)","src/content/blog/git-wip.mdx","147bcba7cee2a3da","happiness-is-an-extremely-uneventful-subject",{"id":82,"data":84,"body":87,"filePath":88,"digest":89,"rendered":90},{"title":85,"description":14,"pubDate":86},"Happiness is an extremely uneventful subject",["Date","2024-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Florence\n\nFlorence Welch is my favorite artist.

It’s not.\n\nWhen you need help with something technical, try following the template below. A few things to keep in mind:\n\n- Include more details and context\n  - If you're asking for help in Slack, please make your first message a brief description, then add more details **in a thread**. This way, the main channel isn't cluttered up/hard to read, and your specific thread with all the discussion is easy to reference later if needed.\n- Default to asking in the team channel (instead of one person via DM). There are a few reasons for this:\n  - Selfishly, you're more likely to get help quickly\n  - Others may have the same problem, and benefit from you asking\n  - Team leads/managers/etc. can see what types of problems we tend to run into as a team, and get a better feel for what processes, documentation, workflows, etc. need improvement.\n  - If you _do_ need to DM a specific person, please be upfront in your first message about what you need help with. This avoids taking up several minutes waiting for them to see your message, then them waiting for you to ask your question, etc. This also applies in channels/group chats as well.\n\n**Bad first message asking for help:**  \n\"Hey Mark, how are you?\"\n\n**Good first message asking for help:**  \n\"Hey Mark, how are you? This Laravel controller I am writing is not returning the correct JSON result and I can't figure out why. Do you have a moment to Zoom? Here's what I've already tried: [followed by the below format]\"\n\n---\n\n### Template for asking for help:\n\n**Title:** Brief description of the problem  \n**What I did:** Steps you took. Be specific. Include lots of detail. Add any information you think might be helpful, and then add more.  \n**My environment:** What operating system, browser, editor, tool version (e.g. node, npm, python, php, etc.), etc. are you using?  \n**What I expected to happen:** What it says – what outcome were you expecting to get?  \n**What actually happened:** Again, include lots of detail here! Add screenshots, log file snippets, etc. More information is good.  \n**What I've already tried:** Include solutions you've already tried, so the person helping you doesn't waste their time and yours suggesting things you have already done.\n\nOnce you've written these things down, read through them and try to anticipate what questions someone might ask. Then, go back through this and add whatever information you can to preemptively answer those questions.\n\nThe goal is to minimize time spent back-and-forth asking questions and gathering more information, so that you can get unblocked more quickly, and so that the person helping you can get back to their work more quickly.\n\n---\n\n### Here's an example of a bug report that is incomplete:\n\n\"I can't get docker to work with connect on my machine.\"\n\n### Here's an example of a bug report that has a lot more information and is more likely to get you the help you need:\n\n\"\"\"  \nI'm unable to get Connect to work on my local machine using Docker.\n\n**What I did:**  \nI ran `docker-compose up` and navigated to `http://localhost:8081` in my browser.\n\n**What I expected to happen:**  \nI thought that after running `docker-compose up`, I would be able to see the connect application at http://localhost:8081 in my browser.\n\n**What actually happened:**  \nWhen I nagivate to `http://localhost:8081`, I see a \"502 Bad Gateway\" error page.

The \"kiosk\" allows you to search for users of your application, and click a button to sign in as that user. This is great for things like white-glove onboarding, recording screencasts for a user to show them a feature, etc.\n\nIt's quite common to use something like Intercom, FullStory, etc. to track users in your application. You might want to keep tabs on how often they log in, what actions they take, and so on. But, if you use that impersonation feature, you'll trigger that tracking for a user's account when they aren't actually using the app! And, you probably don't care about using something like FullStory to track your own usage of the app.\n\nI wanted a way to avoid this problem, and after some digging, I discovered that Spark sets a `spark:impersonator` session key when using the impersonation feature. As a result, we can check for that in our app's `app.blade.php` layout file, and conditionally set a javascript variable:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/930fca70f68949a5a54ee98ae0da04bd.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nWe can then check for that variable in our javascript, and skip user tracking if it's present.","src/content/blog/limit-user-tracking-in-a-laravel-spark-application.mdx","04e34c010a03793d","making-axios-work-with-external-resources-in-laravel-spark-apps",{"id":161,"data":163,"body":166,"filePath":167,"digest":168,"deferredRender":13},{"title":164,"description":14,"pubDate":165},"Making axios work with external resources in Laravel Spark apps",["Date","2018-12-06T00:00:00.000Z"],"import OldPost from \"../../components/OldPost.astro\";\n\n\u003COldPost />\n\nIn [MemberScore](https://memberscore.io), we make use of a WordPress plugin to connect a user's site to MemberScore. The easiest way to provide that plugin is to give users a zip file that they can upload through their WordPress admin area. I could ship a zip file with my Laravel application, but since I'm already hosting that plugin's code on Github, it seems silly to also add it to the Laravel application, and to update the file each time I make a change to the plugin code.\n\nGithub does give you a [/latest release URL](https://github.com/tnorthcutt/member-score-wp-plugin/releases/latest) that redirects to the most recent release of a repository, but that would still require users to then click on the correct download link – plus it's an extra step.\n\nInstead, I opted to make use of the Github API, which returns that latest release as a json object: [https://api.github.com/repos/tnorthcutt/member-score-wp-plugin/releases/latest](https://api.github.com/repos/tnorthcutt/member-score-wp-plugin/releases/latest). I'm then able to grab the first element of the `assets` array in that object, and use the `browser_download_url`. In my Vue component:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/9ee01af0f3d7f5684ad6b7172c98a658.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nYou'll notice there that I'm fetching the Github URL with axios. By default, [Laravel Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/) makes use of [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), a handy dandy \"promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.\" Axios is very convenient to use. However, Spark also sets some default headers on requests sent with axios:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/84a5a4b26d69aea91c25310c65568d56.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nAs a result, you may run into some issues using axios for external requests (outside of your application). Here's a [Laracasts thread](https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/javascript/axios-without-csrf-and-requested-with-headers) explaining just that problem. This was the case for me; performing that request resulted in this nasty error message:\n\n```\nAccess to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.github.com/repos/tnorthcutt/member-score-wp-plugin/releases/latest' from origin 'https://app.memberscore.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field X-CSRF-TOKEN is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.\n```\n\nThe solution turns out to be deleting the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header just before making the request, then adding it back afterwards (so we don't break things for other parts of the application):\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/tnorthcutt/2a0dd75fc6dc8f5defc05605009bf41b.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nWhile this seems like a bit of a messy workaround, it does indeed work. There is currently a [pull request on the axios repository](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/1845) to allow setting a header to `null` on an individual request and not sending that header as a result; that would be far preferable. As of this writing, axios still sends an empty header if you set it to `null`, which breaks [Access-Control-Allow-Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers).","src/content/blog/making-axios-work-with-external-resources-in-laravel-spark-apps.mdx","395c670144576798","show-commit-history-on-posts",{"id":169,"data":171,"body":174,"filePath":175,"digest":176,"rendered":177},{"title":172,"description":14,"pubDate":173},"Showing commit history on posts",["Date","2020-09-08T00:00:00.000Z"],"Update: since converting this site to use [Astro](https://astro.build), I needed to change how the commit history component works.

It's useful. I mean, if you really had to know the truth of your partner in its nakedness, it'd be unbearable half the time. You know, you want just a bit of self-delusion, actually. You don't want denial, but you do want to hold on to something imaginative. That is what allows you to step outside of the situations that we get into and kind of say it's not that important because there's a bigger plot. There's a massive narrative here that is more important, and it is called a relationship.\n\nI find this very thought-provoking! I think there are maybe a few reasons I find this interesting:\n\nFirst, at least to me, \"self-deception\" carries some baggage. I suspect most people probably have at least an initial negative reaction to the idea of self-deception. We'd like to think we're \"better than that\" – we see things the way they really are, rather than through a homemade prism of lies.\n\nI think that's silly. I think most (all?) people, myself included, deceive themselves every day about a myriad of things. And that's ok! This can be a healthy way of dealing with what can often be the difficult realities of life. All things in moderation, of course[^1].\n\nMy interpretation of what Esther said is that sometimes it's necessary to deceive ourselves in for the greater good of the relationship (\"there's a massive narrative here that is more important, and it is called a relationship\").[^3]\n\nAfter pondering this for a while, I think my stance looks something like this:\n\nThat self-deception _is_ important and useful in a young relationship. Amanda and I met when we were just eighteen. As it turns out, eighteen year olds are at least slightly imperfect![^2] But, helpfully, eighteen year olds are also capable of slight (enormous?) amounts of self-deception. As a result, we found it rather effortless to look past each others' faults. Or rather, not to even see them at all.\n\nAnd that's great! We could just stop there, and probably be perfectly happy.\n\nBut I think there's more. In fact, I know there is. I think ideally, that self-deception grows and matures into grace over time.\n\nAmanda and I have been together for nearly twenty years now, and I feel quite certain she could catalog my faults, my weaknesses, my failings better than anyone else. After all, she is lucky enough to experience those things more often than anyone else.\n\nMy friend Visa has a great thread on this topic, [starting here](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1060046145936777217):\n\n\u003CTweet id=\"https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1060046145936777217\" />\n\nDespite all of that, we're still married! We love each other, intensely. Fanatically.\n\nActually \"despite\" isn't right at all. It's more _because of those faults_, I think, in a way. Grace is powerful enough that we can see those faults – truly, deeply, see them – and say \"yeah, that's my person\". In a sense we're choosing to adopt those faults as our own. To fully own them, and accept them, and love them.\n\nSo, I'm pretty sure that ideally, young self-deception grows into wise and chosen grace. Eyes wide open, fully seeing, and fully choosing grace[^4].\n\n[^1]: Ok not literally. Not _all_ things. \"Some things in moderation\" doesn't quite have the same ring, though.\n[^2]: We're perfect now, of course.\n[^3]: I feel compelled to note that I'm not trying to disagree with/argue with/whatever Esther Perel. I think she's very wise and has contributed an immense amount of good to relationship discourse. I'm really just trying to riff on what she said, and extend it.\n[^4]: Of course, grace alone isn't enough for a healthy marriage (or any other relationship).

What is that? At a basic level it's just the steps you take or go through, right? It's the steps you take to plant a garden, or wash the dishes, or do your work of whatever kind. I suspect if we go through a process with intention, care, and reverence, then that's where we can be changed and affected.

That's the [sacred and mundane](https://travisnorthcutt.com/the-sacred-and-mundane/). \n\nBut I have a hunch that if we take that approach with us wherever we go – as much as we remember, or are able to – then we might find we're affected and stretched and pushed and pulled into new shapes, or perhaps into the shapes our selves really want to be formed into, but that we haven't let ourselves be.\n\nSo then it's being open and attentive to the process in more ways. That's what I'm doing here, right? I'm writing this to process my thoughts. And it's not the end result that really matters, that might really deeply affect me (or anyone else). It's the process of writing it, of reaching down into my self and grasping whatever thoughts I can and making a messy attempt to put words to those thoughts and shape them into something that might for just a moment make some sense to me, and perhaps to you, too. \n\n_My wife, Amanda, told me some months ago that she thought I needed to write an essay with this title, and for that I am grateful._","src/content/blog/the-process-is-the-point.md","f1539f0d78971a9c",{"html":238,"metadata":239},"\u003Cp>Everyone has heard some variation of “it’s the journey, not the destination, that matters” a hundred times.
