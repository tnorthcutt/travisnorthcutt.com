_This post, much like the previous one, is a bit of a departure for me. Let's see what happens._

Noticing your partner. Again, and again, and again  
Doing the dishes for 30 years, cheerfully, each night  
Healing yourself so you can be fully present  
Working to stay strong and healthy when it’s hard and you’re tired  
Resting when you need to, so they can rest when they need to  
Carrying the load when your partner cannot, for as many years as it takes  
Letting your partner carry the load when you’re overwhelmed and hurting  
Letting go of who you were or thought you might be and finding yourselves together  
Caring about whatever they care about, just because they care about it  
Laying yourself bare and trusting that it is safe to do so  
Making it safe for your partner to do the same
