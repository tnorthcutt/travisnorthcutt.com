[Atuin](https://atuin.sh/) and [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) are two of my favorite command line tools. They do one thing really, really well and best of all, I don't have to remember to use them â€“ they're just there, working perfectly.

Today I learned that Atuin integrates with zsh-autosuggestions, by automatically adding itself as an autosuggest strategy.
