# Coaching

I am currently enrolled in a level 1 coach training course with [Coach Training EDU](https://www.coachtrainingedu.com/). As part of my training, I'm offering free coaching calls. I'm most interested in coaching folks on areas relating to finding purpose & meaning in their life, work, relationships, hobbies, etc.

If that's something you're curious about, please email me! I'm deeply curious about people and love to hear what they're working on, what their hopes and dreams are, and what gets them going!
