> _December 2015 update: I wrote a book on freelancing/consulting with my mastermind group. [Learn more about that here.](http://travisnorthcutt.com/buy-our-book/)_

I've been exchanging emails with a friend about his career, which includes considering whether to make a stronger move toward freelancing over employment. Yesterday he asked me this:

> I guess I’m more of at of a loss of where to get clients. I honestly have no idea. I was thinking there was two routes to go down. 1) work with agencies or 2) work with small businesses. I figured the agency route would be much easier from a developer point-of-view, but since I haven’t done either, I’m just guessing. Which do you work with? Have a preference? Advice?

Here's what I said, which should be useful to others not in his specific situation as well:

We ([The Bright Agency](http://brightagency.net/)) pretty much exclusively work directly with the end client. We've been happy with that, but if I were starting from a blank slate, I'd be going after whatever I could find, and building some agency relationships would almost certainly be part of that. I wouldn't advise making that a long-term strategy as I believe your profit would be very limited, but it would get some projects under your belt and pay the bills. At the same time, I'd be trying to find end-client work as well. I think I'd give Robert Williams' [Workshop](http://letsworkshop.com/) a try - I haven't paid for the service as we get enough work without it, but his content is great, and I think it's a compelling sales pitch for someone in your position.

I'd also **strongly suggest** reading [Double Your Freelancing Rate](http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/) if you haven't already - it has a pretty solid foundation on pricing, how you position yourself and communicate that to leads/clients, etc. I'm a big believer in moving beyond the "$xx/hour for \_\_\_\_ development/design service" model, and toward the "$xxx/hour or \$xx,xxx/week for making your business big money" model. I'd also suggest calling yourself a "consultant", instead of a "freelancer". Again, it's all about the positioning.
