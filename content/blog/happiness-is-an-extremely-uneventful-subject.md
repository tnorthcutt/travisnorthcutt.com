## Florence

Florence Welch is my favorite artist. One of her songs, [_No Choir_](https://open.spotify.com/track/47a7Hn4fFE4mHgVJF19CO1?si=c16553351de7429d), starts like so:

And it's hard to write about being happy  
'Cause, the older I get  
I find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject  
And there will be no grand choirs to sing  
No chorus could come in  
About two people sitting doing nothing

## Jimmy

I listened to Jimmy Carr on a podcast a while back, and he said something that stuck with me. Amusingly, I mis-remembered the exact quote, and only realized that just now as I went to dig up the source to link to:

Jimmy says that the meaning of life is "enjoying the passage of time". I'd mis-remembered it as him saying that "happiness is enjoying the passage of time". I prefer my mis-remembered version and I'm sticking with that. I don't claim to know what the meaning of life is, but finding happiness by enjoying the passage of time really resonates with me. It also jives quite nicely with [finding sacred in the mundane](https://travisnorthcutt.com/the-sacred-and-mundane/).

## Now what?

I find that when I'm intensely aware of the shortcomings of my life – when I'm ruminating on them, frustrated by them, wishing that some things were different – it's quite hard to be happy. In those moments I'm looking forward to some imagined (maybe realistic, even) future state where things are _better_.

On the other hand, when I choose to set those things aside and be _present_ (which is becoming such a ubiquitous word that I cringe just a bit writing it, but here we are), and notice what's around me, or _actively choose to look for something beautiful and meaningful in mundane everyday life_, then happiness just... is. In those moments, Florence is right. It's extremely uneventful, but also extremely pleasant and something I can then sit into with ease.

This morning I was shoveling snow, and noticed that if I went the right speed pushing the snow across the driveway, it created a sort of wave/ripple effect radiating out a few inches in front of the shovel as the snow compacted together and sheared away in layers. For whatever reason, I was in a state of mind to notice that and find beauty and meaning in it.

Of course, that's not always the case, for me or for you or anyone else, I suspect. I know from years of experience that being in the dark swampy mire of depression can render everything I've just said above a laughable, alien idea. I would imagine there are other things that would keep someone from finding this mode of being attainable.

But I hope, if you're able, just for a moment, you'll choose to find happiness in enjoying the passage of time.
