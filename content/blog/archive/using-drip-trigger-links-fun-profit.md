In a recent email to [my list](https://memberup.co/strategy/) (sign up if you run a membership site _or_ if you like awesome gifs), I recommended that any membership site without a discussion forum should seriously consider setting one up (building community is one of the best ways to keep members sticking around for longer). My forum software of choice is [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), so I put together a very quick post on [how to set up Discourse](https://memberup.co/set-discourse-membership-site/). Nothing fancy, just some basic instructions, and more importantly in the context of the email, it was *something to link to.*

Then, in my Drip broadcast, I set up the link to that post as a trigger link:

![trigger link](./images/trigger-link.png)

I then set up a workflow to run when that link is clicked:

![discourse workflow](./images/discourse-workflow.png)

Now, I've established that there's interest in setting up Discourse, and I have an extremely targeted list of people to market to, offering to do that for them. I'll likely promote that service more widely as well, but I can push it more heavily to that list. Repeat with multiple other products & services, and using trigger links in your emails becomes a pretty powerful tactic.
