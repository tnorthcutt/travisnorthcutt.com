> _December 2015 update: I wrote a book on freelancing/consulting with my mastermind group.Â [Learn more about that here.](http://travisnorthcutt.com/buy-our-book/)_

The other day, I tweeted some advice to freelancers, including "don't call yourself a freelancer." I got a few responses asking why, so here's an explanation.

In your clients' minds, freelancers are inherently less valuable than \[professional whatever you are\]. Their neighbor's unemployed college dropout kid who has a nice camera calls himself a freelancer. Their stoner second cousin who makes a pittance on Fiverr calls herself a freelancer. Is that who you want to be associated with?

Besides being asked why, I also got replies asking if not freelancer, then what? If you're a writer, call yourself a writer. If you're a designer, then say so. If there's not a succinct term that encompasses what you do, then use "consultant" as your title.

Call yourself a professional, conduct yourself like a professional, deliver professional results, and set professional prices. You'll enjoy your work a lot more, and earn more in the process.
