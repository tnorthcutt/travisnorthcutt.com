In the spirit of "those who write down their goals are more likely to achieve them":

- Write frequently (at least two times a week).
- Exercise consistently (at least two times a week).
- Consistently wake up early. For me, right now, this means before 6am.
- Earn money from something other than client work (book(s), one-time software product(s), SaaS, etc.).

These are my (public) goals for 2013.
