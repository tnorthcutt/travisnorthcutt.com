Around the end of one year and the start of the next, a lot of people like to post year in review posts, and they often include goals and plans for the next year. Heck, I did that myself, [earlier this year](http://travisnorthcutt.com/goals-for-2013/ "Goals for 2013"). I was even considering doing that recently, after reading my friend [Carrie's year in review post](http://www.carriedils.com/2013-year-review/ "Carrie Dils' year in review"). However, after reading [this article by James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems "Systems not goals"), I'm convinced to focus instead on what kinds of systems I can put in place, instead of setting arbitrary goals to achieve. For instance, I've been tossing around the idea of writing a book on using Git with WordPress. Several people have even asked me to do so, so I feel confident that there's a good chance of a market for it. However, instead of setting a goal of writing that book in 2014, I'm going to instead just write about using Git with WordPress once a week. It doesn't matter how much I write - just something, at least once a week. That could be a tiny little tip, a problem I encountered that week and how to solve it, etc. I'm going to take the [two-minute rule](http://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating "How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the “2-Minute Rule”") very literally.

So, that's it. That's the system I'm going to follow next year. Write about Git, once a week. Yes, that seems ridiculously simple, and doesn't even scratch the surface as far as all that I really want to do and accomplish. However, it's very specific, and very achievable.

What about you? What system are you going to put in place?
