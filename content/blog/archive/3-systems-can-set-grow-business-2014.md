> _December 2015 update: I wrote a book on freelancing/consulting with my mastermind group. [Learn more about that here.](http://travisnorthcutt.com/buy-our-book/)_

In [my last post](http://travisnorthcutt.com/dont-set-goals/ "Don’t set goals"), I talked about the relative value of setting up systems versus setting goals. Basically, the argument is that if you set goals but don't set up systems, you might not get anywhere. However, if you set up systems, but don't have a concrete goal in mind, you can still make forward progress. (The idea behind this and the motivation for that post comes from James Clear, who [goes into more detail on the concept](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems "Forget About Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead."))

With that in mind, I want to share some ideas for systems you could set up for yourself and your business, based on what I'm doing in 2014. This assume you're some kind of freelancer/consultant doing design/development/marketing type work, but these same ideas could easily be applied to other types of businesses and people in other situations. Need help applying them to your situation? [Email me](mailto:travis@travisnorthcutt.com "email me") and just ask - I read and reply to every email I get from readers.

On to the systems!

## Set up a system for regular writing

It's no secret that [writing](http://nathanbarry.com/365/ "Nathan Barry on writing every day") [regularly](http://chrislema.com/blog-1-million-pageviews/ "Chris Lema on growing his blog") can have a huge impact on your business. What might not be obvious is all the different ways it can benefit you.

**1\. More traffic to your site** Google loves fresh content, and the more fresh content you post, the more search traffic you'll get to your site. This is definitely a long-term benefit; don't expect stunning results overnight. However, if you stick with it, the results can be very impressive (and impactful).

**2\. Build an audience** What should you do with all that traffic you get? Build an audience, of course. Don't just give people to read and no way to stay connected to you: ask them to sign up for your email list (while offering them something of value, of course), then \*\*help them\*\* by sending them useful information often. Later on (or now, if you're ready), when you have something to sell, you'll have a (hopefully large) group of people who care about what you have to say and trust you, and who will thus be hot leads for whatever you're selling.

**3\. Become a better communicator (and look more professional)** Have you ever received an email from someone that was poorly written? Was your first reaction that this person must be a well organized person who has great attention to detail and who would be wonderful to work with? Probably not. Fair or not, you're judged by your writing when it comes to the web and email. Better writers are able to communicate faster, more clearly, and come across as much more professional (and thus valuable). Want to get better? Just start writing. I hunted ducks a lot growing up, and we always joked that with a new shotgun you had to "get all the misses out" - it was our silly excuse for missing an easy shot. However, in writing, there's an element of truth there - you won't get the bad writing out of the way until you get it out on the page. The only way to improve is to practice.

### Set up a system to ask for referrals

This is something I've done a terrible job of in the past, but no more. Our business is almost entirely built on referrals, and yet we've done nothing to maximize that stream of leads. Starting this year, we'll be contacting a past client every week (until we've exhausted our past client list) to ask for a referral (and something else; see #3). We also recently added to our processes a calendar event that reminds us to follow up a few weeks after a project conclusion to make sure the client is happy with everything and to ask for referrals (after we make sure they're happy!).

Please don't be like us and wait until you haven't talked to a client in months to ask for a referral. Instead, check in with them a few weeks after a project's completion, make sure they're happy with the results, and ask for the referral. The added benefit here is that sometimes, you'll find out they were happy with your work, and have been thinking about asking you to do some more stuff they don't have time for, and your call was just the nudge they needed to hire you again.

### Set up a system to build up a new stream of revenue

Maybe you're trucking along just fine with your current business model and are happy with your income level. If so, that's great! But maybe you're like us, and you want to both grow your revenue, and have more predictable & stable monthly revenue numbers as well. We've found that one-off web projects, while something we're great at, can be frustrating. We pride ourselves on building great relationships with our clients, but then we just get the final check and call it a day. What a waste! To put a stop to this, we've started selling productized consulting services. Basically, a client pays us a fixed monthly fee (but it's not a retainer - this isn't buying a package of hours), and we help them [grow their business via their website](http://brightagency.net/black-light "The Bright Agency's optimization service").

To jumpstart this revenue stream, in 2014, when we contact past clients to ask for a referral, we'll also talk to them about this service and see if it would be a good fit for their business. It won't be for all of them, but at the very least they'll learn about it, and possibly be able to refer someone else to us who might be interested in it. Also, when we talk to new prospects, we now talk about this service from the very beginning, with an eye toward either starting them off with it before doing a full website project, or moving them to this service at the conclusion of a full web project.

Can you use any of these ideas for systems in 2014? If you don't think you can, [email me](mailto:travis@travisnorthcutt.com "email me"); I'd love to help you figure out a system you can use to grow your business and improve your life this year.

Can I ask you a favor? If you know someone who might benefit from this (and other content like this), could you share this with them? I'd love to help more people grow their businesses and improve their lives in 2014. Thanks!
