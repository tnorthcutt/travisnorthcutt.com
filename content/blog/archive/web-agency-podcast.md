I recently appeared on the [Web Agency Podcast](http://www.webagencypodcast.com/048/ "Web Agency Podcast") with Mat Newton, and had a great time. Mat and I talked about our (mine and my [partner Michael's](http://elsteele.com/ "Michael Steele's site")) journey building our agency. We coverÂ having a partnership, raising our prices, changing your mindset, conversion optimization, and much more. Give it a listen, and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to help.
