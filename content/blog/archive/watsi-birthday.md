Today's my birthday! I made it another year, and I am extremely blessed, most especially by my wonderful wife Amanda and our son Kyle.

I have one request for all of you today: please consider donating toÂ [http://watsi.org/](http://watsi.org/), my favorite charity. Watsi funds healthcare for those in need around the world, and does so in a radically transparent way (all of their financials are publicly visible). 100% of your donation goes directly to fund medical care; operating expenses are covered by foundations, philanthropists, and donors who leave an optional tip.

If you don't feel called to donate or can't afford to right now, that's totally fine! But please share this; perhaps someone else will. And have a great day!

And if you do donate, please comment here or let me know on [twitter](http://twitter.com/tnorthcutt)!
