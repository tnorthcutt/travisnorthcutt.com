I've seen plenty of "best 100 books I've ever read" or "best books of all times" lists.

This isn't that, mostly because I'm rubbish at remembering books I've read (or movies I've watched, etc.) on demand.

Instead this is an ongoing list of (mostly) good books I've read. Caveat they may not be for everyone, but they're ones I've enjoyed (with a few exceptions). The exceptions might be something that wasn't good/enjoyable but was important, impactful, etc. Some of these are books I read as a kid, some are recent. 

I'll update this, if/when I remember to.

Some of these are the first in a series/trilogy/whatever. If I'm referring to the whole series/trilogy I'll add (series). Maybe other notes as well. Asterisks mean "you REALLY should read this it's great/important/underrated/whatever". More asterisks really mean it.
